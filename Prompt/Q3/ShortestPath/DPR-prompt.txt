You are a visual intelligence assistant. ###Uncertain Graph Explanation###: Each tuple should consist of three elements: (node1, node2, weight), where "node1" and "node2" are the nodes connected by an edge, and "weight" is the numerical value associated with the undirected edge. The edges are represented by the tuples:\n {edges_representation}. \n ###Question### : Give the shortest path from node {a} to node {b}. Present the multi-step reasoning process: 1. Graph Edges Identification: Use tuples to represent the edges in the graph, derived from a comprehensive analysis of both the image data and graph explanation. 2. Algorithm Selection and Code Generation: Select an appropriate algorithm and provide a concise explanation, followed by the corresponding executable code. This code should utilize the tuples identified in the first step. 3. Multi-Step Reasoning Process: Detail each step taken in the reasoning process, explaining how the algorithm applies to the graph under consideration. 4. Final Answer: Regardless of whether the previous steps can be executed successfully, provide a definitive answer without any explanation following the rule: The answer should be a clear statement summarizing the path and its total weight: "4.the shortest path from node {a} to node {b} is... with a total weight of...".(e.g., "The shortest path from node 1 to node 2 is 1-3-2 with a total weight of 5.")

You are a visual intelligence assistant. ###Uncertain Graph Explanation###: The edges in the graph are represented by tuples, where each tuple consists of two nodes connected by an undirected edge. The edges are represented as follows: {edges_representation}. ###Question###: Is there a path in this graph that visits every node exactly once? Present the multi-step reasoning process: 1. Graph Edges Identification: Use tuples to represent the edges in the graph, derived from a comprehensive analysis of both the image data and graph explanation. 2. Algorithm Selection and Code Generation: Select an appropriate algorithm and provide a concise explanation, followed by the corresponding executable code. This code should utilize the tuples identified in the first step. 3. Multi-Step Reasoning Process: Detail each step taken in the reasoning process, explaining how the algorithm applies to the graph under consideration. 4.Final Answer: After completing the analysis, provide a definitive and unexplained answer based on the following criteria: A Hamiltonian path must traverse each node in the graph exactly once without revisiting any node. If impossible to reach every node exactly once, conclude decisively with "No, there is no Hamiltonian path in the graph." If a Hamiltonian path is feasible, affirm with "4.Yes, there is a Hamiltonian path in the graph. The Hamiltonian path is ... ." (For example, "Yes, there is a Hamiltonian path in the graph. The Hamiltonian path is 1-2-3-...-N.") This step requires a clear conclusion, independent of the success or failure of the previous steps."

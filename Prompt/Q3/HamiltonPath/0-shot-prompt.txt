You are a visual intelligence assistant. Is there a path in this graph that visits every node exactly once? If yes, give the path. Note that in a path, adjacent nodes must be connected with edges. Demand: If there is a path, conclude your answer with "Yes, there is a path in the graph. The path is...", and provide the specific nodes involved in the path in sequence. If no path exists, please conclude with "No, there is no path in the graph."

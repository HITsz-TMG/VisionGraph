You are a visual intelligence assistant. ###Uncertain Graph Explanation###: Each tuple should consist of two nodes that are connected by an undirected edge. The edges are represented by the tuples:\n {edges_representation}. \n ###Question### : Is there a path between node {a} and node {b} in the graph? Present the multi-step reasoning process: 1.Graph Edges Identification: The response should begin with: "1.The edges of the graph are represented as tuples:" followed by the identified tuples representing the edges in the graph, derived from a comprehensive analysis of both the image information and the graph explanation. Each tuple should consist of two nodes that are connected by an undirected edge; 2.Algorithm Selection and Code Generation: The response should include: "2.The algorithm and corresponding codes are:" followed by a brief explanation of the chosen algorithm and the corresponding code. The code should be able to execute directly using the tuples generated in the first step. 3.Multi-Step Reasoning Process: The response should continue with: "3.The process of multi-step reasoning is as follows:" This part should detail each step taken in the reasoning process, explaining how the algorithm is applied to the given graph. Each step of reasoning can only use the following sentence patterns: The neighboring nodes to node X are node A, B... 4.Final Answer and Summary: If there is a path between node {a} and node {b}, conclude your answer with "4.Yes, there is a path between node {a} and node {b}. The path is node1-node2-node3-...(eg.1-2-3-...)", and provide the specific nodes involved in the path in sequence. If no path exists, please conclude with "No, there is no path between node {a} and node {b}."

You are a visual intelligence assistant. ###Uncertain Graph Explanation###: The edges in the graph are represented by tuples, where each tuple consists of two nodes connected by an undirected edge. The edges are represented as follows: {edges_representation}. ###Question###: Is there a cycle in the graph? Present the multi-step reasoning process: 1. Graph Edges Identification: Use tuples to represent the edges in the graph, derived from a comprehensive analysis of both the image data and graph explanation. 2. Algorithm Selection and Code Generation: Select an appropriate algorithm and provide a concise explanation, followed by the corresponding executable code. This code should utilize the tuples identified in the first step. 3. Multi-Step Reasoning Process: Detail each step taken in the reasoning process, explaining how the algorithm applies to the graph under consideration. 4. Final Answer: Regardless of whether the previous steps can be executed successfully, provide a definitive answer without any explanation following these rules: A cycle must consist of at least three nodes. If even one edge does not exist, a cycle cannot be formed. If no cycle exists, answer decisively with "No, there is no cycle in the graph." If a cycle exists, state "4.Yes, there is a cycle in the graph. The cycle is ... ." (e.g., "Yes, there is a cycle in the graph. The cycle is 1-2-3-...-1.")

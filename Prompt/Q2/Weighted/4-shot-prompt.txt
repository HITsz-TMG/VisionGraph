You are a visual intelligence assistant. The first url refers to the first graph and the second url refers to the second graph. Following the four in-context reference examples shown in the first graph, answer the following question for the second graph: Please use tuples to represent the edges in the second graph. Each tuple should consist of three elements: (node1, node2, weight), where 'node1' and 'node2' are the nodes connected by an edge, and 'weight' is the numerical value associated with the undirected edge.
